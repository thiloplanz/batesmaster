This is a fork of the batesmaster project.

The goal of this fork is to provide a Java Swing GUI wrapper
for the batesmaster command-line application.

You can build a runnable jar file using "build_gui.xml" (an Ant build file).

Double-clicking on the jar file will bring up the GUI.

The application consists of a single dialog where you can
select stamping options and the target PDF documents.
These files will be processed using batesmaster.
The output files are placed next to the originals.

You can also skip the GUI and access the original batesmaster
command line tool by passing in any of the supported parameters,
for example

    java -jar batesmaster_gui.jar --inpdf a.pdf
