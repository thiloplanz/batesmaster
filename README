This is a fork of the batesmaster project.

The goal of this fork is to provide a Java Swing GUI wrapper
for the batesmaster command-line application.

You can build a runnable jar file using "build_gui.xml" (and Ant build file).

The application consists of a single dialog onto which
you can drag PDF files from the OS file explorer.
These files will be processed using batesmaster.
The output files are placed next to the originals.
